                <p>Hi all, my name is Tanya Holczer.</br>
                    I am 37 years old (almost 38, and still in denial about it), married with 3 children. </br>This is Langley, British Columbia. My home for the past 8 months.
                </br>I've been playing World of Warcraft since 2009.</br>
                I enjoy reading books very much (I own over 3,000 books), riding horses, and my new passion - skiing.
                </p>

                <p>This is my neighborhood, Willoughby. We've decided to move here so that my almost-10-year-old daughter, Alice, could swim in the Langley Olympians, the best swim team in western Canada.</p>

                <p>These are my kids: </br>Alice, 10, a gifted swimmer (now competing for the Regional team); </br>Connor, 7, just started studying martial arts; </br>Lyra, 1.5, favorite pastime is eating. </br>
                The picture was taken during the first snow of the year. Unfortunately, we don't get enough of these in the region.</br>
                We moved here because we love cold weather, snow, and rain, and despise heat. </br>It's very challenging because I'm studying at college for a PBD in programming and IT full-time, and Alice and Connor have each 5 practices a week (Alice even has swim practice at 5:45 AM on Thursdays!&#128562;), and Lyra is a little rascal.</p>

                <p>This picture was taken in Israel. </br>These are our two dogs - Skye, a Border Collie, and Marshall, a Boxer. They are 4 years old.</br>We took them with us to Canada. Because no airline would fly Boxers (or any snub-nosed dogs) to Canada, we had to fly to LA and make a road trip by car to Vancouver. It took us approximately 1600km and 5 days to complete, and it was a challenge to load an SUV with all our luggage, two dogs, three kids, and two adults. Still can't believe we moved here with only six suitcases..</p>
