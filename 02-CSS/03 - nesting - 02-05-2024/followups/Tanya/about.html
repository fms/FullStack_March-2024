            <h2>General info</h2>
            <p>My name is Tanya Holczer.
                I am 37 years old, married with 3 children (10, 7, and a half).
                Recently, I moved with my family and our two dogs (a Boxer and a Border Collie) to Langley, British Columbia. Previously, I was a high school physics teacher, and now I am making a career change.
                I am studying for a Post-Baccalaureate Diploma in software development (Java, C#, Python, PHP, React ..) and IT here at Douglas College (a 2 year program - I have 1 year left).</p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>I've been playing World of Warcraft since 2009.
                I enjoy reading books very much (I own over 3,000 books), riding horses, and my new passion - skiing.</p>
